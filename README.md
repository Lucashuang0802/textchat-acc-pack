# OpenTok Text Chat Accelerator Pack<br/>Version 0.9

The OpenTok Text Chat Accelerator Pack provides functionality you can add to your OpenTok applications that enables users to exchange text messages between mobile or browser-based devices. 

With the OpenTok Text Chat sample app, you can:

- Initiate and manage interoperable text chat communication between two users, regardless of the devices they are using.
- Customize the UI features and layout.

You can create mobile apps for Android and iOS, or embed the interactive session between users into any website. 

To get started with your development, visit the following sites:

- [OpenTok Text Chat Accelerator Pack for Android](./android-text-chat)
- [OpenTok Text Chat Accelerator Pack for iOS](./iOS-text-chat)
- [OpenTok Text Chat Accelerator Pack for JavaScript](./js-text-chat)

_**NOTE:** The Text Chat Sample App requires a **Session ID**, **Token**, and **API Key**. In the samples, you can get these values at the [OpenTok Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/). For production deployment, you must generate the **Session ID** and **Token** values using one of the [OpenTok Server SDKs](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/server/)._
